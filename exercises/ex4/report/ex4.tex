\section{Introduction}
For the programming belonging to this problem set, see $\textit{ex4.c}$ file in
the zipped archive attached to this report. This program calculates the
difference between the sum of a finite hyperharmonic series, and the convergence
sum for an infinite hyperharmonic series. This program is able to compute the
difference between the two in the following scenarioes;

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Using one thread and a single process on a single processing core
for the program's computations.}
	\item{Using one process and multiple threads concurrently on a single
processing core for the program's computations.}
	\item{Using multiple processing cores concurrently for the program's
computations.}
	\item{Using multiple threads on multiple processing cores concurrently for
the program's computations.}
	\label{RunMode}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Series $S_n$}

A \textit{hyperharmonic} series is a series of the following form;

\begin{displaymath}
	\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i^p}, \quad \quad with \quad n = \infty.
	\ref{HyperSeries}
\end{displaymath}

This problem set wants us to write a program with $n = 2^k$, where $k$ is given
as parameter at \todo{Confirm phrasing of program initiation}program start. This
problem set also specifies $p$ to be a constant; $p = 2$. With $p = 2$, the sum
of this hyperharmonic series converges to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$.

The objective of the problem set is to compute the difference between
$\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and the sum of a finite series where $n = 2^k$, with $\{k \in
\mathbb{N} : k \in [3, 14]\}$. This difference is what the program written for
this problem set is supposed to calculate.

\section{Concurrency Implementation}

The program was developed in iterations. The first iteration ran on a single
thread in a single process on a single processor core, in a non-concurrent
sequential fashion. The second iteration introduced running the program as
mentioned in item 2 in \cite{RunMode}. This was enabled by putting the following
line into our \textit{ex4.c} file.

% \begin{lslisting}
% 	#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, 5) reduction(+:sum)
% \end{lslisting}

The third iteration focused on combining items 3 and 4 from \cite{RunMode}.
Since OpenMP is enabled through the use of pragmas, making the code run with MPI
was then only a matter of choosing the right compiler and compilation switches.
Hence, in effect the third iteration only focused on implementing MPI into the
program.

To utilize MPI, the program does need to use a subset of the available MPI
function calls; $\textit{MPI\_Scatter()}$, $\textit{MPI\_Send()}$,
$\textit{MPI\_Receive()}$, $\textit{MPI\_Gather()}$, $\textit{MPI\_Init()}$,
$\textit{MPI\_Finalize()}$, and so on. Not all of these are necessary, but a
minimum subset of these are. Such as, $\textit{MPI\_Init()}$ and $\textit{
MPI\_Finalize()}$, and then one of the $\textit{MPI\_Scatter()}$ alternatives ,
or $\textit{MPI\_Send()}$. Likewise there are more than one
$\textit{MPI\_Gather()}$, but only one of its forms or $\textit{MPI\_Receive()}$
are necessary.
